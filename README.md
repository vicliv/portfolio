# Victor Livernoche — Portfolio

A simple, fast personal website for my academic profile, publications, and projects. It’s currently under active development, so content and visuals will evolve.

## What This Is
- A minimalist portfolio to introduce who I am, what I work on, and how to reach me.
- Sections include Home, About, Publications, Projects, and Contact, with a downloadable CV.

## Visual Theme
- The animated background renders a field of nodes and links on a canvas. These “neural” nodes nod to my work and interest in machine learning while also evoking star fields and constellations in space—another personal interest.
- Motion respects system preferences (reduced motion) and is optimized for performance.

## How It’s Built
- Stack: plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).
- Fonts/Icons: Inter (Google Fonts) and Font Awesome.
- Features: responsive layout, EN/FR language toggle, accessible alt text, and a downloadable CV.

## Run Locally
- Option 1: open `index.html` directly in your browser.
- Option 2: serve statically, e.g. `python3 -m http.server` and visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: page structure and sections.
- `styles.css`: theme, layout, and animations.
- `script.js`: interactive background, i18n (EN/FR), and UI behavior.
- `images/`: assets like the portrait.
- `CV.pdf`: downloadable resume.

## Roadmap (In Progress)
- Refine copy, add more publications and projects.
- Polish accessibility and mobile interactions.
- Incremental visual and performance tweaks.

Feedback is welcome—this site is evolving.
